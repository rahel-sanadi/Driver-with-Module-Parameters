Kernel Memory Allocator Test Module
 Description

This Linux kernel module demonstrates dynamic memory allocation inside the kernel using kmalloc() and safe memory release with kfree().
On module load, it allocates a small memory buffer (128 bytes by default), logs its address and size, and frees it when the module is removed.

 Skills Covered

Memory allocation in kernel space using kmalloc()

Memory deallocation using kfree()
