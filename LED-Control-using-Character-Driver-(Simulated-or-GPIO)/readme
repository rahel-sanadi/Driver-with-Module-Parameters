LED Control using Character Driver
ðŸ“Œ Description

This project demonstrates a simple Linux character device driver that controls a simulated LED (or real GPIO if running on embedded hardware).

Writing 1 to /dev/led turns the LED ON.

Writing 0 to /dev/led turns the LED OFF.

Any other input is treated as invalid.

It is designed for learning and experimenting with Linux device driver development.

ðŸŽ¯ Skills Covered

Character device registration (register_chrdev, unregister_chrdev)

Implementing write() file operation

GPIO output handling (if real hardware is available)

Simulation support using QEMU or kernel log messages
