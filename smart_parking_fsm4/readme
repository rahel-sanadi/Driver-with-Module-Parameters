 Smart Parking Simulation using FSMs

Project Title: Smart Parking Simulation Using FSM for Radar and Camera Modules  
Author: Rahel Sanadi

Description:
This project simulates a simple embedded-style parking system using Finite State Machines (FSMs). It uses two FSMs: one for radar-based vehicle detection and another for camera-based number plate recognition. The program reads parking event logs from an input file called `car_info.txt` and writes the processed output to `output.txt`, showing each car's plate number and its parking duration.

Files Included:
- main.c           : Main driver program
- radar.c/.h       : Radar FSM logic (simulated vehicle detection)
- camera.c/.h      : Camera FSM logic (simulated plate recognition)
- car_info.txt     : Input file with parking data
- output.txt       : Output file generated after running
- README.txt       : This instruction file

Input Format (car_info.txt):
[EntryTime] [PlateNumber] [ExitTime]

Example:
08:00 KA01AB1234 10:15
09:30 MH02CD5678 11:00
12:00 TN03EF9012 12:45
07:00 GJ05GH3333 08:30
18:59 RJ14EE5555 23:59

Output Format (output.txt):
[PlateNumber] [Duration in HH:MM]

Example:
KA01AB1234 02:15
MH02CD5678 01:30
TN03EF9012 00:45
GJ05GH3333 01:30
RJ14EE5555 05:00


How to Compile and Run (using GCC):

Step 1: Make sure you have GCC installed. You can check using `gcc --version`.

Step 2: Place all `.c` and `.h` files along with `car_info.txt` in the same folder.

Step 3: Open terminal/command prompt in that folder (Vs code).

Step 4: Compile using:
    gcc main.c radar.c camera.c -o smart_parking

Step 5: Run the compiled program:
    ./smart_parking 

Step 6: After execution, check `output.txt` in the same folder for results.

Note:If your folder is located somewhere else on your computer and also the above steps are not working try these methods and check to get output:-

1) Use the cd (change directory) command.

eg:- cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents\C_Projects\SmartParking

2)If your folder is on another drive (like D: or E:) then switch drives first:

eg:-  D:
      cd path\to\your\folder

3) List Files to Confirm You're in the Right Place:

eg:- dir

4) Compile the Code (Make sure GCC is installed) (vs code):

eg:- gcc main.c radar.c camera.c -o smart_parking

5) Run the Program:

eg:- smart_parking.exe
