This Linux kernel module demonstrates how to fetch and print the current system time when the module is loaded.
It uses kernel time functions to retrieve the current time in seconds and nanoseconds, then logs it with printk().

Skills Covered

Working with kernel time functions (ktime_get(), ktime_to_timespec64())

Logging time information via printk()

Understanding kernel time structures (ktime_t, timespec64)
